📅 Day 3 – Topics Covered

Today, I learned and implemented deeper backend-level Go concepts focused on memory reference, struct design, composition, and abstraction.

| Folder/Concept                  | Topic / Understanding                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **14_pointers**                 | Understood memory addresses using `&` and value access/modification via dereferencing `*` (reference-based updates).                      |
| **15_structs**                  | Learned to model real entities using structs (`type User struct {}`) and access/modify fields using dot notation (`u.name`).              |
| **16_embedded_structs**         | Learned struct composition by embedding one struct inside another for reuse (`type A struct { B }`).                                      |
| **17_interfaces**               | Learned method contracts using `type Animal interface { Speak() }` and struct-based interface implementation for scalable backend design. |
| **18_struct_interface_binding** | Practiced assigning a struct instance to an interface type and calling methods polymorphically (`var a Animal = Dog{}`).                  |

📝 Summary of Day 3 Learning

Pointers help pass data by reference instead of copy, useful inside functions and struct updates

Structs are used for clean data modeling in backend systems

Embedded structs provide structure reuse without duplication (Go’s composition model)

Interfaces ensure scalable, testable, abstraction-friendly code

Practiced interface implementation inside structs

No direct slice == comparison → used slices.Equal() ✅

Map grows by inserting keys, slice grows by append() ✅

Ran Go code using terminal inside VS Code confidently

📅 Day 5 – Topics Covered

Today, I learned and practiced concurrent and scalable Go concepts including goroutines, synchronization using WaitGroup, generics, and enum-like patterns using constants/iota.



| Concept                    | Usage / What I learned                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goroutines**             | Learned lightweight concurrency using `go func()` for parallel execution and improved performance.              |
| **WaitGroup**              | Understood synchronization to wait for multiple goroutines using `sync.WaitGroup`, `Add()`, `Done()`, `Wait()`. |
| **Enums**                  | Implemented enum-like behavior using `iota` with constants (`type Status int`).                                 |
| **Generics**               | Learned to create reusable type-safe functions using generics (`func PrintAny[T any](v T)`).                    |
| **WaitGroup + Slice Flow** | Used `WaitGroup` inside loops to wait for parallel tasks dynamically.                                           |

## 📅 Backend Foundations – HTTP & JSON APIs (Today)

Today, I focused on **real backend development in Go** by learning how HTTP servers work and by building APIs using the `net/http` package.

### ✅ Concepts Learned

| Concept                    | What I Learned (Backend View)                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSON (Client ↔ Server)** | JSON is the data contract between client and server. Client sends request JSON, server decodes it into Go structs, processes logic, and encodes response JSON back. |
| **Struct Tags**            | Used `json:"field"` tags to correctly map JSON keys to Go struct fields and maintain API contracts.                                                                 |
| **net/http Package**       | Learned how Go provides built-in tools to build HTTP servers without external frameworks.                                                                           |
| **http.ListenAndServe**    | Starts the HTTP server, listens on a port, and routes requests using the default router (`ServeMux`).                                                               |
| **http.HandleFunc**        | Registers API routes and acts as the default router when `nil` is passed to `ListenAndServe`.                                                                       |
| **Handler Functions**      | Implemented handlers with signature `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)` to process requests and send responses.                                          |
| **http.ResponseWriter**    | Used to set headers, status codes, and write JSON responses back to the client.                                                                                     |
| ***http.Request**          | Used to read HTTP method, headers, URL path, query params, and JSON request body.                                                                                   |
| **JSON Decoder / Encoder** | Used `json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&struct)` for request parsing and `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(struct)` for responses.                                           |
| **HTTP Methods**           | Understood GET for fetching data (idempotent) and POST for sending/creating data (non-idempotent).                                                                  |
| **Idempotency**            | Learned that GET can be safely called multiple times, while POST changes server state on every call.                                                                |

### 🛠️ APIs Built

| API            | Method | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/profile`     | GET    | Returned user profile data as JSON response                             |
| `/create-user` | POST   | Accepted JSON request body, decoded it into struct, and echoed response |

---

### 🔁 Backend Request–Response Flow (Locked In)

```
Client JSON → HTTP Request → Handler → Decoder → Go Struct
→ Business Logic → Encoder → HTTP Response → Client JSON
```

---

### 📝 Key Takeaways

* Backend APIs revolve around **handlers, JSON, and HTTP methods**
* Structs are internal models, JSON is an external contract
* Decoder is the input gate, Encoder is the output gate
* Always validate method, JSON, and headers
* Typed code written by hand improves understanding and debugging skills

🚀 This session marked my transition from Go basics to **real backend API development**.
